# **CommentsFilter**
* Filter comments by different criteria, be able to easily add new filters and modify old ones.
* Let's say we filter spam, comments with negative content, and comments that are too long.
    * Spam will be filtered by the presence of the specified keywords in the text.
    * Negative content will be determined by the presence of one of the three emoticons - :( =( :|
    * Too long comments will be determined based on this number - the maximum length of the comment.
